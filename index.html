        G-Eazy was actually born and raised in Oakland California, beforemoving to New Orleans to go to college and pursue his dreams of beinga rapper. After graduating from University in 2012, he went on a 40-dateAmerica's Most Wanted Music Festival with Lil Wayne, TI and 2 Chainzwithout technically having a "home" or many possessions. He told RollingStone: "What costs the world to you as a working kid fresh out of college,costs nothing to you as a successful musician… I felt like the idea, thecreative content, was so much more valuable than any physical content. Likeif this works, I could buy 100 couches." G-Eazy got his big break when heeased his mixtape 'The Endless Summer' in 2011, which earned him the chance togo on tour with Drake and Lil Wayne. From there Gerald wrote, recorded, andproduced his first full-length album 'Must Be Nice' completely independently- and earned the No. 3 spot on the iTunes Hip-Hop Chart.

        <div class="item1">peaking to Hip Hop DX about his unique look, he said: "My mom would play all these old Johnny Cash records and stuff, and my grandpa was real big on it. I grew up with my grandparents—my mom, aunts, uncles in this big house. I was just raised around that kind of music. I always thought he was cool, just being a rebel, dressing in all black, and not wanting to always conform."</div>
